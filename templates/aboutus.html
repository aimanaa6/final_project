    <p class="lead text-center">
        Kaasp Bakery is more than just a bakery — it’s a celebration of colour, creativity, and community.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
        Founded by five friends with a shared passion for baking, Kaasp was born from the idea that desserts should not only taste amazing but also bring happiness with every bite. The name "Kaasp" is a blend of our founders’ initials, symbolising unity and friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
        Inspired by the colours of the rainbow, we set out to create a space where each bake tells a story and every customer feels like family. From bright, fluffy cupcakes to layered celebration cakes bursting with colour, every creation is crafted with joy and love.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since opening our doors, Kaasp Bakery has grown into a local favourite, known for its bold themes, playful designs, and welcoming atmosphere. Whether you’re celebrating a big occasion or just stopping by for a treat, we’re here to add a little colour to your day.
