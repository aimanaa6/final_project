        Kaasp Bakery is more than just a bakery — it’s a celebration of colour, creativity, and community.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
        Founded by five friends with a shared passion for baking, Kaasp was born from the idea that desserts should not only taste amazing but also bring happiness with every bite. The name "Kaasp" is a blend of our founders’ initials, symbolising unity and friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
        Inspired by the colours of the rainbow, we set out to create a space where each bake tells a story and every customer feels like family. From bright, fluffy cupcakes to layered celebration cakes bursting with colour, every creation is crafted with joy and love.
    </p>
    <p>
        At Kaasp, community means everything. We love collaborating with local artists, hosting themed baking days, and celebrating the little moments that make life sweet.
        Our bakery is a place where creativity meets tradition — where new ideas are layered over time-honored recipes to create something truly special.
    </p>
    <p>
        Whether you're picking up a cake, sipping one of our signature drinks, or simply browsing our rainbow of treats, we hope you feel the love, care, and passion that go into every corner of Kaasp Bakery.
